# AndroidTinderSwipe
The project demonstrates the swipe similar to tinder app.

For implementation part view the Activity.
There is a small catch in implementation part, the view added last if shown on top.
So you will have to add like, 2nd image first, then the first image.
There is also a slight blinking , due to that fact that I clear out the viewgroup
and add views again.
